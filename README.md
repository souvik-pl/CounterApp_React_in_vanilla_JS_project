# Counter Application
This simple counter application is developed using HTML and vanilla JavaScript, without relying on build tools like Create React App (CRA) or Vite. The application utilizes the 'react' and 'react-dom' library loaded via a CDN. Since, we are not using 'babel' here, we won't be able to use JSX syntax in this application.

## Features
- Increment and Decrement: Easily increase or decrease the counter value with the click of a button.
- Reset: Reset the counter to zero with the reset button.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- 'react' and 'react-dom' library (loaded via CDN)

## How to Use
- Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Use the "+" and "-" buttons to increase or decrease the counter.
- Click the "Reset" button to set the counter back to zero.
